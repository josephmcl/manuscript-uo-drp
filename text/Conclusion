In this work we presented an implementation of a Hybridized 2-D Poisson equation, implemented in the PETSc scientific computing library, and parallelized in OpenMP. 
Hybridized problems are assembled from multiple elements and coupled with interface conditions, which in total comprises the problem's volume.
This problem is solved in two parts, wherein a sparse system is solved, allowing for the solution to be computed independently for each element.  
We developed a theoretical model of the work required to compute the problem in FLOPs, derived from the mathematics of the problem. 
We also provided a description of the problem size in bytes loaded, and the number of write operations that occur in major operations. 
We conducted an experiment to demonstrate that the overall time-to-solution for this system is heavily effected by the number and size of each element chosen.
For one problem with 705\,600 grid points we found the optimal runtime when we used 100 $40\times40$ elements. 
Finally, we determined that the largest operations in the problem were latency bound, discussed strategies for reducing the effect, and what effects this might have on larger problems.
