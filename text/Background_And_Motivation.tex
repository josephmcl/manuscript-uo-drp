In this section, We motivate this work with a brief review of related approaches to solving linear elliptic PDEs on parallel architectures. 
Additionally, we provide a description of the 2-D Poisson Equation that we study in this work. 
Finally, we provide a background on the hybridization, as well as with the SBP-SAT method that we use in the assembly of our problem.
