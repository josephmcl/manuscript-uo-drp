The hybridized formulation of numerical partial differential equations (PDEs) addresses the large amounts of memory needed to solve large systems of equations. This approach splits the domain into several smaller elements can be solved individually after computing a dense global problem that is used to condition each local problem. Hybridized methods are most commonly found in finite element methods (FEMs) \citep{rhebergen2017analysis, frigo2021efficient, fernandez2017hybridized}. However, recent work has assembled finite difference methods (FDMs) with with a hybridized formulation \citep{kozdon2021hybridized}. In either case, the hybridized formulation is typically utilized by application scientists and applied mathematicians for it's ability to formulate a simpler
