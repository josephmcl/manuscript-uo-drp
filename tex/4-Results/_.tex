\section{Performance evaluation in shared memory}
\noindent 
The most performant PDE solvers for large-scale problems are increasingly based on GPUs, but often do so by constraining properties of system, such as enforcing FPD-ness in the case of iterative solvers. We show that the hybrid SBP-SAT method can be compute similarly large problems with fewer constraints on the CPU.
