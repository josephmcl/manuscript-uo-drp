\section{DISCUSSION}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Contextualize performance 
	\item -- This is useful in heterogeneous domains, increasing the heterogeneity doesn't increase the cost that much (quantify)
	\item -- Ours is shared memory, others are distributed memory 
	\item -- PETSc should be a good starting point to scale this problem up 
	\item Opportunities for performance in shared memory
	\item -- MKL version 
	\item -- Optimizing out batch GEMM kernel 
	\item -- Using parallel GEMM on larger kernels 
	\item Applications / Future work 
	\item -- Using optimal element size as a predictor of optimal element size in larger problems 
	\item -- Homogeneity of the problem as a function of performance 
\end{itemize}
